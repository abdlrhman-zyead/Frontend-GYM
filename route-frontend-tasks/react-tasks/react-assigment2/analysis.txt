same task-1 just styling by tailwind css framework
Analysis -> clear Build
### ðŸ”µ **TASK ANALYSIS**
Goal**: Rebuild this website ðŸ‘‰ [https://routeegy.github.io/startFramework/#/](https://routeegy.github.io/startFramework/#/)
**Using**: React + Components + Routing
**Deadline**:

### âœ… **STEP-BY-STEP PLAN**

#### 1. **Set up your React project**

* Create a new React app using your IDE or terminal. (npm create vite@latest)
* Clean unnecessary files (like `App.css`, `logo.svg`).

#### 2. **Understand the structure of the sample website**

* Explore and write down the main sections/pages (e.g., Home, About, Portfolio, Contact).
* Observe what repeats on all pages (like Navbar, Footer).

#### 3. **Create Components for each part**

* Make a component for each page.
* Make shared components (e.g., Navbar, Footer) once and reuse.

#### 4. **Add React Router**

* Install and set up React Router DOM.
* Wrap your app with `<BrowserRouter>`.
* Create routing paths to switch between your components (pages).

#### 5. **Build the layout**

* Add Navbar at the top and Footer at the bottom.
* Use a main layout component to wrap pages and keep design consistent.

#### 6. **Style your components**

* Match the sample website's styles using CSS or a CSS framework.
* Make sure your pages look similar to the reference.

#### 7. **Test your routes**

* Click all links and test the navigation between components.
* Fix anything that doesn't work as expected.

#### 8. **Final check before submission**

* Check spelling, styles, responsiveness, and routing.
* Run your project and confirm it works correctly.

#### 9. **Submit before the deadline**

* Push your code to GitHub or the required platform.
* Double-check the link is working before 10 PM Tuesday.

### ðŸ§  TIPS

* Work step-by-step, donâ€™t jump ahead.
* Focus on understanding how components and routes work.
* If something breaks, isolate and fix it one small part at a time.

assigment

now i list allcomponents in APP file i want create lot pages
so i want create routing


idea of rout /componentName appear component name
not correct list components under our
so based on route of component i appear it

1 - installl react-roter-dom


-> JS built in objust location.hostname and location.pathname in BOM

2 - so i create any route by method called createBrowserRouter i create by it list include lot of objects each object include path and element (called component in Angular) we will return i want all thing about it
it take pathe and whice component or html code or  ... ? will return , not must name path be same name component but what best practice

we put list of routers in variable and path to component RouterProvider as props value
3 - Return component in return scope of App function (App component) use <RouterProvider routes={variableOfListOfRouters}/>
e.g
import './App.css'
import Home from './Home/Home.jsx'
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"
import {RouterProvider} from "react-router-dom"
function App() {
const router =createBrowserRouter(
    [
        {
          path:"/",
          element:<Home/>
        }
    ]
)
  return (
    <>
        <RouterProvider router={router}/>

    </>
  )
}

export default App

but now we navigate by url i create request manull so we has loading with each request
behind the seen the components replace from request to another mean old component remove and new component replace it
